module Make (Label : Comparable.S) (Former : Type_former.S) = struct
  (* We implement efficient level-based generalization by Remy [??].

     In theory, each unification variable has a "level" (or "rank").
     Each variable with the current scope (stack frame [S]) has a level,
     with the outermost level being 0. This is isomorphic to a de Bruijn
     level, denoting the number of binders (stack frames).

     Variables not within the current scope, but within the environment
     frame are "generic".

     We use the efficient presentation from Oleg's blog post ??,
     taking a "lazy" approach. Hence each node within the graphic type
     stores a level, this allows us to delay the propagation of levels
     to generalization.
  *)

  (* Our approach differs compared the approach describe by Oleg.

     There are several problems with representing a "scheme"
     as a type with some quantified variables (determined at generalization).

     Problems:

     - Representation of [var list * type] relies on the invariant that
       all pointers in the var list are indeed variables (our implementation
       doesn't allow this to be distinguished at the type level), and would
       indeed rely on invariants.

     - We must generalize immediately after exiting (due to mutable data in
       graph). Thus the interface defines implementation behavior. BAD!

     - Cannot recompute quantified variables after generalization (due to
       mutated data). This doesn't fit well with notions of
       higher-rank polymorphism.

     Requirements of  solution:

     - Quantified variables are re-computable in any given level

     - Representation mimics "graphic types"
  *)

  (* Solution:
     
     To re-compute generic variables, we need 2 pieces of information,
     the level of scheme and the level of every variable (including generic 
     ones). 

     Thus we store the level of the scheme in the representation of [scheme]
     and each generic variable keeps the level it initially had (prior to 
     generalization). 

     To distinguish between generic and non-generic (instance) variables w/ levels, 
     we use a tagged sum-type:
     
     type tag = 
      | Instance of { mutable level: level }
      | Generic of level 
      
     This removes the notion of a "generic level" (used within the OCaml type 
     checker). Our actual representation is optimized (but provides a similar 
     interface to the one above).

     This allows us to update levels in a lazy manner, as described

     do not propagate this throughout the type. We perform this update

     reach nodes within the old region.

     Historically: This function assumed that all types
     within the current region were acyclic (a problem!)

     The point of update levels is to ensure that every
     node within young generation has it's correct level.

     since levels can only decrease, it follows that we only need to visit

     generic flexible variables also occurs here.
