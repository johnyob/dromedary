(* This module implements an imperative data structure for disjoint sets
   (commonly known as `union-find'), based on Tarjan and Huet.

   Union find implements a family of disjoint sets on values, where
   the disjoint sets can dynamically be combined using [union].

   A disjoint set [D] is a family of disjoint sets [D = {t1, ..., tn}],
   with the following operations:
   - [create v]: creates a new set [t] containing [v] in [D].
   - [find v] returns the (unique) set [t] in [D] that contains [v].
   - [union t1 t2] performs the union of [t1] and [t2] in [D].

   A disjoint set [D] is represeted using a forest, a collection of trees,
   each node in the tree storing it's value, with pointers to parents.

   Operations:
   - [find v]:
     This traverses the element [v] back to the root [r] of the set,
     creating a path [p] (the `find' path).

   Path compression is performed on this operation, which updates the
   parent pointer to point directly to the root [r].

   - [union t1 t2]:
     We use union by rank. Each set stores the `rank', an upper bound for the
     height of the tree. The set with the smallest rank becomes the child,
     with the edge case of equal ranks.

   This implementation is optimized for the representation of equivalent
   classes. Each equivalence class containing a "value".
*)

(* Trees representing equivalence classes are of the form:
   {v
            Root
             |
           Inner
        / .. | .. \
     Inner Inner Inner
      /|\   /|\   /|\
      ...   ...   ...
   v}

   With directed edges towards the parents.
   The root of the class contains the [rank] and value of type ['a].
   Internal nodes contain a pointer to their parent.
*)

(* [compress t ~imm_desc ~imm_desc_node ~prop_descs] compresses the path
   from [t] upwards to the root of [t]'s tree, where:
   - [imm_desc] is the immediate descendent of [t], and
   - [prop_descs] are proper descendents of [imm_desc]

   The use of [imm_desc_node] is to avoid additional heap allocation
   when performing path compression.
